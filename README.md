# DnD

This is a basic dice selector for my current DnD character, Georgie. In the future, I'd like to add options to create new characters, add more weapons, and maybe a character creator option. This was used to get an understanding of the game, and I still use this version while I'm playing. It's not beautiful, but it gets the job done.
